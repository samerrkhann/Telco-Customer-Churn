# Telco-Customer-Churn
IBM dataset

## Introduction
in this dataset, I have tested using XGboost. Also, support vector machines and Logisitc Regression are used as extras to test if model can perform well using those algoirthm but XGBoost outperformed them all. 
This Notebook explains the entire work flow of using XGBoost in classification and Fine tuning it to improve the scores. 
The problem has been approached in a view point to give extra importance to correctly classifiying the Customer who are going to leave. Initially the Recall the was (51%).
This however after cross-validation improved to (81%). This is a perfect example of how powerful the XGBoost is in classification problems

## Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

## Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Inspiration
To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.
